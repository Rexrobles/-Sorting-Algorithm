# QUICK SORT
# choose any element as pivot
# move the pivot to the end of array
# look for itemFromLeft that is larger than pivot
# look for itemFromRight that is smaller than pivot
# swap the item from left to item from right
# Repeat the process, stop when index of itemFromLeft is greater than index of itemFromRight
# Swap the pivot with itemFromLeft
# repeat until all element are sorted
